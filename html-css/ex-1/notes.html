            <h2>Thought Process</h2>
            <p>For the first level, I focused on creating a basic structure with a header, footer, and main content. Semantic elements such as <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> were used to enhance readability and organization.</p>
            <p>The second level introduced a golden layout with two navigation menus and a table. I ensured proper structure without CSS to meet the requirements.</p>
            <p>In the third level, I added dummy text, alt text for accessibility, and labels for table headers to improve the usability of the webpage.</p>

            <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintaining proper alignment and spacing without CSS was challenging but manageable with semantic HTML.</li>
                <li>Ensuring accessibility required additional consideration for alt text and descriptive content.</li>
            </ul>
