Grid Layout with grid-template-areas: The grid-template-areas property was used to define distinct named sections for the header, sidebars, main content, and footer. This makes the layout highly readable and manageable.

Handling Overflow Content: In Level 2, the overflow: auto; property was added to the .main content area to ensure that any overflow content is handled properly (e.g., scrollbars are displayed if necessary).

Responsive Layout with Media Queries: A media query was used to modify the grid layout for smaller screens (e.g., tablets and mobile devices). The layout shifts from a three-column design to a single-column design, stacking the content vertically.

Using minmax() for Flexible Sizing: In Level 3, minmax() was used for the left and right sidebars to make their width flexible, ensuring that they remain between 200px and 300px, adjusting based on available space.
